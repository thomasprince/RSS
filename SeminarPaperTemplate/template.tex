\begin{abstract}
Software security is an idea implemented to secure software against malicious attack and other hacker risks so that the software continues to function correctly under such potential risks. Security is necessary to provide integrity, authentication and availability. The fast growth rate of software and software products makes the software security aspect even more critical. Most organizations these days want their information system to be managed as safely as possible. Security Evaluation is the basic step in achieving this goal for any organization. Security Evaluation is particularly important because of the rapidly changing environment of the information security system or the operation system.In this survey we are performing a study on Software Security Evaluation techniques. A detailed analysis of Qualitative and Quantitative Security Evaluation approaches is being carried out. The suitability and challenges of different methods of each of this approach is studied. The systems where these techniques are being used are investigated to understand the performance of security evaluation methods. Finally, the paper is concluded with the scope of the different security evaluation approaches for real time systems.

\section{Introduction}

  Software security is the idea of engineering software so that it continues to function correctly under malicious attack \cite{1281254} .The fast-growing software systems and huge amount of data handling makes the software security an important aspect in Modern software development. Software security has to be evaluated to make sure that software is minimally susceptible to threats. Evaluation of software security is so challenging because of the non-predictability of the threats and attacker behaviors.

  Introduce the different sections of this paper shortly in one or two sentences.

  
\section{Importance of Security Evaluation}
Why do we need Security Evaluation?

\section{Software Security Metrics}
Metrics is a measurement standard which defines what is to be measured, how to be measured and helps the security practitioners to manage the product efficiently. Security metrics is the powerful tool that helps security practitioners to integrate security features into their system. The security metrics are gaining lot of significance now a days because with the help of the data obtained from them software security decisions can be taken and which in turn helps the software developers to secure their software product. 

Security metrics help in decision making regarding security-related attributes of a process, system, or organization. In particular, security metrics can be applied to compare the effectiveness of different security mechanisms, or to indicate the degree to which security requirements of an organization are being met. In addition, they can also be used to systematically improve the security level of a system, or to predict this security level in a future point in time. All the people involved in the software life cycle from developers to users use the security metrics for different use cases. For example Technical Personnels(Developers) use security metrics to decide which configuration change is the most effective to increase network resilience, Management members for financial investment on security and finally end users for the trustworthiness of a software products available in the market.

The desired properties of a good security metric are granularity, availability, cost effectiveness, localization and validation\cite{8017389}.
